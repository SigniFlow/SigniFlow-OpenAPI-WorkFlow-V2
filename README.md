# SigniFlow OpenAPI Specifications  

SigniFlow uses the OpenAPI (OAI) Specification - formerly known as "Swagger" - to describe its REST APIs. The goal of the OAI specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.  For more info see the official [OAI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) spec.

## The Swagger file

`SigniFlow-OpenAPI-V2.yaml` - the full swagger file for SigniFlow's eSignature REST API V2


## What can I do with a Swagger file? 

We use OpenAPI/Swagger files to build many of our developer tools including our [client SDKs](https://signiflow.github.io) using `swagger-codegen`. We also use the OAI specification to build our [API Docs](https://developers.signiflow.com/docs/signiflow-openapi-V2/docs/introduction.md).
